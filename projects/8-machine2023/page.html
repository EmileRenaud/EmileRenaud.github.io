      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>This year challenge was to build a machine that can move across the island with the help of bridge that the machine need to place itself. It also need to connect the islands with a cable. For all the details
        of the challenge, you can go <a href="https://jeuxdegenie.qc.ca/jdg/2023/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Machine_Handbook.pdf">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Composed of 6 members in robotics and mechanical engineering, the <i>Team Machine</i> tried to make the best machine possible to complete this challenge. Even if our machine didn't perform as well as in the 
      trainning sessions, we still manage to beat all the others participant by a lot.</p>

  <H2>Electrical Section</H2>
  <p>Here my cup of tea, electrical stuff. For another year, I was charge to design a custom PCB that please all the requirement of the mechanical team. That mean : control a lot of actuator on the smallest PCB possible...
    That PCB can handle up to 6 DC motors including two of them with encoder feedback. It can also power up to 12 servos with differents voltages (5V and 7.4V). Two of my custom DC-DC are used to power the servos.
    The motor's driver are setup with custom circuit that allow us to reset the power of the drive.</p>
